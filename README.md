# Loan-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository presents a predictive analysis project on loan defaults using data from a national bank collected in 2017, covering 3,500 customers in the Middle Atlantic and Northeast USA. The analysis aims to identify key factors contributing to loan defaults and develop predictive models to mitigate potential financial losses. Key findings from the exploratory data analysis suggest that lower incomes, higher debt-to-income ratios, loan purpose, application type, credit history, and homeownership status significantly impact default probabilities. The project features Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, with the former achieving a prediction accuracy of 91.89% and the latter demonstrating strong discriminative power with an AUC of 90.47%. This comprehensive analysis provides insights that help the bank enhance its lending decisions and reduce financial risks.
